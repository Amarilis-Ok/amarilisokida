                <p>Translating is not simply transporting words from one language to another; it is promoting a whole cultural experience.<br />
                    You want Brazilian people to go beyond what is said. You want them to feel, taste and visualize your ideas.<br />
                    I will make it possible for them.</p>

                You developed a company, came up with outstanding products or services and invested in nice materials to show them, and I am sure you want to keep quality to introduce your brand wherever you go. <br />
                Being an expert in storytelling, I will help you adapt your presentation as if it had originally been written in Brazilian Portuguese, taking into account what is in your mind and our local culture.
